@article{che-castaldo2021critical,
	abstract = {The electric power grid is a critical societal resource connecting multiple infrastructural domains such as agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. The electrical grid as an infrastructure is shaped by human activity and public policy in terms of demand and supply requirements. Further, the grid is subject to changes and stresses due to diverse factors including solar weather, climate, hydrology, and ecology. The emerging interconnected and complex network dependencies make such interactions increasingly dynamic, posing novel risks, and presenting new challenges to manage the coupled human--natural system. This paper provides a survey of models and methods that seek to explore the significant interconnected impact of the electric power grid and interdependent domains. We also provide relevant critical risk indicators (CRIs) across diverse domains that may be used to assess risks to electric grid reliability, including climate, ecology, hydrology, finance, space weather, and agriculture. We discuss the convergence of indicators from individual domains to explore possible systemic risk, i.e., holistic risk arising from cross-domain interconnections. Further, we propose a compositional approach to risk assessment that incorporates diverse domain expertise and information, data science, and computer science to identify domain-specific CRIs and their union in systemic risk indicators. Our study provides an important first step towards data-driven analysis and predictive modeling of risks in interconnected human--natural systems.},

@article{schafer2020bayesian,
	abstract = {The use of accelerometers in wildlife tracking provides a fine-scale data source for understanding animal behavior and decision making. Current methods in movement ecology focus on behavior as a driver of movement mechanisms. Our Markov model is a flexible and efficient method for inference related to effects on behavior that considers dependence between current and past behaviors. We applied this model to behavior data from six greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) during spring migration in mid-continent North America and considered likely drivers of behavior, including habitat, weather and time of day effects. We modeled the transitions between flying, feeding, stationary and walking behavior states using a first-order Bayesian Markov model. We introduced P{\'o}lya-Gamma latent variables for automatic sampling of the covariate coefficients from the posterior distribution, and we calculated the odds ratios from the posterior samples. Our model provides a unifying framework for including both acceleration and Global Positioning System data. We found significant differences in behavioral transition rates among habitat types, diurnal behavior and behavioral changes due to weather. Our model provides straightforward inference of behavioral time allocation across used habitats, which is not amenable in activity budget or resource selection frameworks.},

@article{schafer2018american,
	abstract = {Selection of den sites is a crucial aspect of American black bear (Ursus americanus) life history. High-quality dens provide thermal insulation, protection from disturbance, suitable environment for parturition and cub development, and proximity to available forage upon emergence. Black bears are increasingly coexisting with people in human-dominated landscapes; however, little is known about whether urban environments influence characteristics of dens and den site selection. Our objective was to determine the effect of housing density (a proxy for human activity and availability of anthropogenic resources) on selection of den sites in years of good and poor natural forage. We additionally compared size, shape, and location of dens of males and females to describe den characteristics and explore whether differences existed between males and females. We revisited 34 den locations detected during a 6-year (2005--2010) urban black bear study in Aspen, Colorado, USA, and measured den entrance and den volume. We fit a conditional logistic regression model using a resource selection function framework to determine the importance of housing density and other landscape variables (elevation, slope, aspect, and vegetation type) associated with den site selection. Slope was the best predictor of den site selection and there was no relationship between den selection and housing density, indicating that black bears were neither avoiding nor seeking urban areas for denning. Dens were smaller for females ( = 3.30 m3, SE = 1.94, n = 22) than for males ( = 7.56 m3, SE = 3.31, n = 8), supporting the idea that females have greater constraints in den characteristics, possibly related to cub development and security from predation or because females generally are smaller than males.},
