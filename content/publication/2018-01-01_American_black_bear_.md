abstract = "Selection of den sites is a crucial aspect of American black bear (Ursus americanus) life history. High-quality dens provide thermal insulation, protection from disturbance, suitable environment for parturition and cub development, and proximity to available forage upon emergence. Black bears are increasingly coexisting with people in human-dominated landscapes; however, little is known about whether urban environments influence characteristics of dens and den site selection. Our objective was to determine the effect of housing density (a proxy for human activity and availability of anthropogenic resources) on selection of den sites in years of good and poor natural forage. We additionally compared size, shape, and location of dens of males and females to describe den characteristics and explore whether differences existed between males and females. We revisited 34 den locations detected during a 6-year (2005--2010) urban black bear study in Aspen, Colorado, USA, and measured den entrance and den volume. We fit a conditional logistic regression model using a resource selection function framework to determine the importance of housing density and other landscape variables (elevation, slope, aspect, and vegetation type) associated with den site selection. Slope was the best predictor of den site selection and there was no relationship between den selection and housing density, indicating that black bears were neither avoiding nor seeking urban areas for denning. Dens were smaller for females ( = 3.30 m3, SE = 1.94, n = 22) than for males ( = 7.56 m3, SE = 3.31, n = 8), supporting the idea that females have greater constraints in den characteristics, possibly related to cub development and security from predation or because females generally are smaller than males."
