abstract = "Collective behavior in natural animal systems is a frequent application for agent-based models. Realistic simulations of collective motion in traditional agent-based models is limited in complex environments and lacks notions of autonomy and memory. Reinforcement learning extends the definition of the agent to include perception and memory. The long term value of an agentâ€™s behavior is learned in reinforcement learning by interaction between the agent and its environment. We model this value using a double deep Q-network with a feed forward architecture. The reinforcement learning framework is demonstrated with a multi-agent environment with variable habitat types in a bounded environment. The agents learn to stay within the boundary and collectively move to a positive habitat."
