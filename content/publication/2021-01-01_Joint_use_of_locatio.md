abstract = "Quantifying relationships between animal behaviour and habitat use is essential to understanding animal decision-making, yet frequent observation of marked individuals can be problematic, particularly for migratory species. High-resolution location and acceleration data from recently-developed tracking devices allows unprecedented insights into animal movement and behaviour. These data types allow researchers to study the complex linkages between behavioural plasticity and habitat distribution. We quantified the influence of behavioural state durations and environmental variables on transitions among habitat types through joint use of Global Positioning System (GPS) and tri-axial accelerometer data collected from greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) across seven ecologically distinct winter regions in mid-continent North America. These birds have undergone a large-scale winter distribution shift in recent years, which researchers believe is the result of substantial changes in habitat quality and distribution. We used 57,084 GPS locations and 300,348 accelerometry-derived behaviour bouts from 56 adult greater white-fronted geese during two winter periods. We used a novel Markov model in a Bayesian framework to determine the influence of behaviour on habitat transition rates among winter regions, and included time-of-day and temperature effects on habitat transition probabilities. We found that time spent in specific behaviours explained variation in the probability of transitioning among habitats. For example, as the proportion of time spent feeding in wetlands began to increase, geese transitioned from wetland habitats to agricultural grains, and the latter is their primary food source during winter. Additionally, geese remained in woody wetland habitats when the proportion of time spent stationary increased (i.e., geese remained stationary), suggesting roosting and loafing behaviours are dominant. However, geese transitioned from open water/unconsolidated wetlands to herbaceous wetlands as foraging increased, suggesting different wetland types elicit unique behavioural responses from geese. Geese transitioned among habitat types differently dependent on their wintering region, time-of-day and ambient temperature. Combining GPS and acceleration data allowed unique study of the drivers of a large-scale range shift in the wintering distribution of a migratory bird across midcontinent North America. We showed that greater white-fronted goose decision-making varied across spatiotemporal scales, habitat types, ecoregions, and abiotic conditions, where transitioning among habitat types was influenced by behaviour. We anticipate that behavioural plasticity among variable landscapes is a likely mechanism explaining goose use of a wide range of ecosystems during winter in ways which optimize their persistence."
