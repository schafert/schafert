abstract = "The use of accelerometers in wildlife tracking provides a fine-scale data source for understanding animal behavior and decision making. Current methods in movement ecology focus on behavior as a driver of movement mechanisms. Our Markov model is a flexible and efficient method for inference related to effects on behavior that considers dependence between current and past behaviors. We applied this model to behavior data from six greater white-fronted geese textit{Anser albifrons frontalis}) during spring migration in mid-continent North America and considered likely drivers of behavior, including habitat, weather and time of day effects. We modeled the transitions between flying, feeding, stationary and walking behavior states using a first-order Bayesian Markov model. We introduced Pólya-Gamma latent variables for automatic sampling of the covariate coefficients from the posterior distribution, and we calculated the odds ratios from the posterior samples. Our model provides a unifying framework for including both acceleration and Global Positioning System data. We found significant differences in behavioral transition rates among habitat types, diurnal behavior and behavioral changes due to weather. Our model provides straightforward inference of behavioral time allocation across used habitats, which is not amenable in activity budget or resource selection frameworks."
