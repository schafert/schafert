abstract = "Quantifying relationships between animal behavior and habitat use is essential to understanding animal decision-making. High-resolution location and acceleration data allows unprecedented insights into animal movement and behavior. These data types allow researchers to study the complex linkages between behavioral plasticity and habitat distribution. We used a novel Markov model in a Bayesian framework to quantify the influence of behavioral state frequencies and environmental variables on transitions among landcover types through joint use of location and tri-axial accelerometer data. Data were collected from 56 greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) across seven ecologically distinct winter regions over two years in midcontinent North America. We showed that goose decision-making varied across landcover types, ecoregions, and abiotic conditions, and was influenced by behavior. We found that time spent in specific behaviors explained variation in the probability of transitioning among habitats, revealing unique behavioral responses from geese among different habitats. Combining GPS and acceleration data allowed unique study of potential influences of an ongoing large-scale range shift in the wintering distribution of a migratory bird across midcontinent North America. We anticipate that behavioral adaptations among variable landscapes is a likely mechanism explaining goose use of highly variable ecosystems during winter in ways which optimize their persistence."
