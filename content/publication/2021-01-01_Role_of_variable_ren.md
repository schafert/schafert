abstract = "The U.S. electrical grid has undergone substantial transformation with increased penetration of wind and solar - forms of variable renewable energy (VRE). Despite the benefits of VRE for decarbonization, it has garnered some controversy for inducing unwanted effects in regional electricity markets. In this study, we examine the role of VRE penetration on the system electricity price and price volatility based on hourly, real-time, historical data from six Independent System Operators in the U.S. using quantile and skew t-distribution regressions. After correcting for temporal effects, we observe a decrease in price, with non-linear effects on price volatility, for an increase in VRE penetration. These results are consistent with the modern portfolio theory where diverse volatile assets may lead to more stable and less risky portfolios."
