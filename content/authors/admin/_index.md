I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and 2024 ConocoPhillips Data Science Faculty Fellow at Texas A&M University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University working with Dr. David Matteson. At Cornell, I coordinated research activities associated with the NSF funded [PRISM](https://sites.google.com/view/prism-prj/home) Institute for Trans-domain Systemic Risk. I finished my PhD in 2020 at the University of Missouri advised by Dr. Christopher Wikle. My quantitative research interests span many topics, but with an underlying commonality that includes spatio-temporal modeling, Bayesian statistics, and alternative learning frameworks such as machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. I am highly motivated by scientific hypotheses with an emphasis on ecological and environmental applications. 


**Prospective students**: Students with an interest in ecological data science and/or spatiotemporal Bayesian statistics are encouraged to apply to the PhD program in [Statistics](https://stat.tamu.edu/).
